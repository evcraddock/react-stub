# React Stub

This is a starter React Project that sets up eslint using airbnb configuration, prettier, and jest for testing.

### Commands
* `yarn dev` -- starts the application in dev mode
* `yarn build` -- builds the application `/dist`
* `yarn lint` -- checks for formatting rules specified by the airbnb config and fixes what it can by default
* `yarn test` -- runs all of the tests using jest
* `yarn test:watch` -- watches for changes and runs any tests that apply
